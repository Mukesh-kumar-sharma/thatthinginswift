That Thing in Swift
================

From [the site](http://thatthinginswift.com/):

> How do the Objective-C patterns we already know translate into Swift?

> Patterns are your go-to code chunks; the things you know exactly how to do in Objective-C because you've framed code like it in all of your projects. Swift syntax seems to come pretty easy to iOS developers but we still need a lot of exploration to find the best reimplementations our favorite patterns in Swift.

The site is a statically generated blog built using [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) 0.11, with [a customized version of the Herring Cove](https://github.com/nickoneill/herring-cove-swift) theme.

All of the posts, even some drafts that have yet to make it onto the public site, are in `content` if you'd like to suggest changes or fix stupid spelling mistakes on my part (as a few people already have).
